# Game commutation server
Here is the server written on C# and the client written on C++. In fact, this is just an example, but if you want, you can use it in your project.

I developed a special protocol for the operation of this server. The protocol works through TCP and UDP. There is also documentation, but only in Russian. There is an example of using a client class. The client class fully implements the functionality provided by the server, so you do not need to write your client class in the case of C ++. However, if you need to familiarize yourself with the documentation (rather detailed), you can always use a translator.

This project was only part of another large project. The big project is dead. There was not a single release. However, this part has been completed. I brought her here to save. Like a large project, this part will no longer be developed.
This is the last commit.
